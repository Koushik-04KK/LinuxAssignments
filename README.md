This repository contains a series of Linux assignments that I have completed as part of my shell scripting learning journey. 
The assignments cover a wide range of topics including file management, text processing, conditional statements, loops, process control, user management, and scheduling tasks. 
Through these exercises, I have gained hands-on experience in writing and debugging shell scripts, working with essential Linux utilities like `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, and managing tasks on the Linux command line. 
These assignments helped me build a strong foundation in Linux shell scripting and automation.
